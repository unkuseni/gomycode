# REACT AND  NODE 

### REACT 

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is commonly used for building complex and interactive web applications. React allows developers to build reusable UI components and manage the state of the application. It uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update only the necessary parts of the UI when the state changes.

### NODE

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side and  not  just in the browser
It is commonly used for building server-side applications and APIs. Node.js provides an event-driven model for building  network applications.
